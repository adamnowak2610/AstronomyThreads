# AstronomyThreads

AstronomyThreads is a Fusion 360 library containing a collection of thread profiles commonly used in astronomy equipment. These threads are designed specifically for precision gear in telescopes, mounts, and other astronomical devices. This library is especially useful for 3D printing custom parts that require accurate and compatible threading.

## Features

- Wide range of thread profiles used in astronomy gear
- Optimized for 3D printing
- Easy to integrate with Fusion 360 via Threadkeeper

## Currently implemented threads

- M28.5x0.6 - 1.25 inch eyepiece/filter thread
- M42x1 - standard M42 mount (used in analogue cameras etc.)
- M42x0.75 - T2 thread, very common in photography and astronomy
- M48x0.75 - 2 inch eyepiece/filter thread

## Installation

To use the AstronomyThreads library in Fusion 360, you need to install it with the help of the free [Threadkeeper](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=1725038115223093226) add-in, which allows importing custom thread libraries.

### Steps to install:

1. **Install Threadkeeper add-in in Fusion 360:**
   - Download Threadkeeper from its [offcial website](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=1725038115223093226).
   - Follow the instructions there to install the add-in in Fusion 360.

2. **Download AstronomyThreads library:**
   - Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. **Load the AstronomyThreads library into Threadkeeper:**
   - Open Fusion 360 and launch the Threadkeeper add-in.
   - In Threadkeeper, select Open ThreadKeeper directory.
   - Navigate to the folder where you saved AstronomyThreads and move it to ThreadKeeper directory.
   - Hit Force sync in ThreadKeeper. 
   - You might need to reload Fusion360.

4. **Use the threads in your designs:**
   - When adding threads to components in Fusion 360, select the AstronomyThreads profiles for accurate astronomy-specific threads.
